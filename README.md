# 3D-Model-Watering-Can
A mini watering can custom made for my orchids and their picky needs

## Problem
- couldn't just use a water bottle or store available watering cans for my orchids due to the following:
    - too much water pouring area for my small orchid pots (approximately 8cm in diameter), water would occasionally miss the pot
- orchids are very prone to crown rot, a condition where the center of the plant, the crown, becomes infected and rots due to moisture accumulation from overwatering or water pooling in the leaf axils, easily caused by excess and careless watering accumalating at the orchid's base "stem".

## Solution
- to combat these issues, the watering can must have a spout that is long, thin, and follows natural flow.
    - long and thin - to be able to access the top of the soiling medium without having the rigid leaves and arial roots obstructing the way
    - follow natural flow - so the water pours smoothly and accurately and only goes in the intended direction
      
 - the watering can must be visually pleasing for personal preferences

## Split Model for Ideal 3D Printing
- 3D printing with the model above lead to extra long printing time due to supports for overhanging components
- allowing the spout to be printed seperately allowed for the 3D printer to accurately print it allowing for optimal water flow, due to:
    - the accuracy of printing while fully supported (not a overhanging component) for smoother flow
    - the intricate path of the printer's nozzle also followed the water flows direction compared to if the nozzle's path was orthogonal to the water flow
- the handle was also printed the same way providing a smooth finish to the final product's handle and spout

### Considerations
- even though the 3D printer, Prusa MKS3+, had a 2mm nozzle, it cannot garuntee the 100% of the parts to fix together seamlessly without the possibility of water leaking through the gaps
- so the holes of where the spout and handle attach to the base part were adjusted with an extra allowance, so a smaller hole, to file down until the parts fit very snug
- to elimate the possibility of water leaking through the interaction points, gorilla glue was used to seal all possible gaps

### Limitations
- although the watering can was already meant to be mini, the model to be printed had to be scaled down to fit within my school's allocated 3D printer use per individual per session.
- all parts were scaled down to 87%
